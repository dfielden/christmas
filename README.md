Christmas list app - CRUD webapp to solve the problem of dealing with multiple Christmas list email chains at Christmas and forgetting who has said what.
Technology: Java, Spring Boot, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite.
Users can create Christmas lists - once done they can then them, causing an email to be sent automatically, with a link, inviting others to view the list.
After sharing a list, the creator can no longer edit or remove items but can still add new items.
Users who are viewing lists can very easily select an item (and undo this selection) at the click of a button which will then display to all other users that this item is now selected.
